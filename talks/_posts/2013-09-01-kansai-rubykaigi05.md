## KansaiRubyKaigi05

I gave a talk at [KansaiRubyKaigi05](http://regional.rubykaigi.org/kansai05), a
regional Ruby conference opened at Kansai.

There aren't that much Ruby jobs in kansai, and most of the Rubyists don't
write Ruby in their full time work, even though they want to.

I usually live in Kyoto(included in Kansai) as a student and freelance engineer(currently working for 3 companies).
But all the companies uses Ruby. I talked about how I'm able to write Ruby in
my work even though living in Kyoto, etc.

This was my first time talking in a big tech conference, so my slides/talks
was far from good, but it was a really good experience, and I learned a lot.

Can't wait for next time :).

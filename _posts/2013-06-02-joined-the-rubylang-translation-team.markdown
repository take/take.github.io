[@hsbt](https://github.com/hsbt) was [asking for some volunteers](https://twitter.com/hsbt/status/340288026263576577) for the i18n maintainer of www.ruby-lang.org, I gave a shot and here I am in the [translation team](https://github.com/ruby/www.ruby-lang.org/wiki/Team) :P.

I'm not bright at C, so I can't help the core dev but I guess I can help the translations since I used to live in the states for 3years :).


Would really help if you send a PR when you find any typo or lacking translations in http://www.ruby-lang.org :D.

PS: I never thought I would be able to join the [ruby organization](https://github.com/ruby?tab=members) :P, lol.

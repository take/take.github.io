We allways wander around github right.

Wander around some repos, and look at the source.

It's not bad to click on the folders and look around the source of the repo.

But when it comes to like, 

"I wanna look at the file name 'foo', but its like 5folders away from the root directory of the repo"

, you have to click 5folders to go to the file which you wanna see.

Since github uses Pjax, its not that bad, but it's still a pain in the ass.


When your in a situation like that, just press `t`

The file finder mode comes up and you'll be able to search the hole repo.
